    	<p style="text-align: center;">Well... it lets you have application forms on your server. This is useful for many things such as your server members asking for bot requests, new roles, new server features, etc.
	<h1>Application Bot key features:</h1>
	<ul>
  		<li>Customisable Applications.</li>
  		<li>Space saving storage system (applications don't clog up channels, they are requested by a server admin whenever they feel like it).</li>
		<li>99.9% uptime on a fully dedicated, quick, VPS hosting system.</li>
        <li>Ability to Accept, Deny or delete Applications.</li>
		<li>Channel blacklisting.</li>
  		<li>Professional looking embeded messages.</li>
	</ul>	
	<h2 style="color:#F25251;"> So... how does it work?</h2>
    	<p>First, the server administrator will be asked to input their custom questions, then server members can answer the set questions by typing '%submit'. Their answers will then get automatically deleted and stored in a log that can only be viewed by administrators. The log can then be cleared when server administrators have finished looking at the stored applications.<p>
	<h2 style="color:#F25251;">Need any more help?</h2>
    	<p>If you require and help or would like to ask any questions (before or after you add Application Bot), then please message Sean Hatch (bot creator) on the Application Bot Help Server.</p>
